Every year on the Christmas Eve there's a new Ruby release. This year it's Ruby 2.5. While [many](https://tom-lord.github.io/10-More-New-Features-In-Ruby-2.5/){:target="_blank"} blog [posts](http://blog.bigbinary.com/2017/12/12/ruby-2-5-added-yield_self.html){:target="_blank"} are covering major features like `yield_self`, I wanted to bring your attention to something in the bottom of CHANGELOG, which I think deserves mention.

## Thread.abort_on_exception

```ruby
t = Thread.new do
  raise "omg"
end
sleep 0.5
puts t.status.inspect
```

Would you guess the output of this script? On Rubies before 2.5, it's `nil`. This happens because `Thread.abort_on_exception` is set to `false` by default, which means that you could waste quite some time before you realize that a thread was crashing. To avoid that mistake, I always had to call `Thread.abort_on_exception = true` before spawning any threads.

Ruby 2.5 [sets](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14143){:target="_blank"} `Thread.abort_on_exception` to `true` by default. In my opinion, this is a great decision that could improve developer experience of threads.

There's a [great post](https://eregon.me/blog/2017/12/28/thread-report-on-exception.html){:target="_blank"} by Benoit Daloze, a contributor behind this change, where he explains the background and the reasoning behind the new default.

# ERB's rendering performance

In a Rails app with a large number of views, it's not unusual to see a half of the request time being spent on rendering ERB templates. Faster ERB rendering is a great news!

Takashi Kokubun improved the ERB performance in a series of commits: [r58735](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/58735){:target="_blank"}, [r58916](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/58916){:target="_blank"}, [r58905](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/58905){:target="_blank"}, [r58904](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/58904){:target="_blank"}, [r58842](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/projects/ruby-trunk/repository/revisions/58842){:target="_blank"}. All of them are related to frozen strings or string encoding.

The announcement says that it's "twice as fast as Ruby 2.4". That's BIG, and I wanted to see it myself. I run a [benchmark](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/65d3461e95246ba710a79ea8f6fcf145f872f304/benchmark/bm_app_erb.rb){:target="_blank"} from Ruby repo:

```
$ ruby benchmark/run.rb --matzruby=ruby -m bm_app_erb
```

```
ruby 2.5.0p0 (2017-12-25 revision 61468) [x86_64-darwin17]
app_erb: 1.237

ruby 2.4.3p205 (2017-12-14 revision 61247) [x86_64-darwin17]
app_erb: 1.642

ruby 2.3.4p301 (2017-03-30 revision 58214) [x86_64-darwin16]
app_erb: 1.129
```

While I could see 30% boost between 2.5.0 and 2.4.3 on my machine, 2.3.4 still produced a better result. Maybe it's my hardware?

# Standard gems

Before, when you wanted to make a change to a standard library like FileUtils or CSV, you had to send a patch to `ruby/ruby` and go through the complete review process.

In Ruby 2.5, a number of standard libraries were promoted to default gems: cmath, csv, date, dbm, etc, fcntl, fiddle, fileutils, gdbm, ipaddr, scanf, sdbm, stringio, strscan, webrick, zlib.

Now if you want to make a change to something like `StringIO`, it's as simple as sending a PR to the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ruby/stringio){:target="_blank"}.

title: Better way to use the Struct

We use Structs in Ruby to create simple classes with constructor and some instance variables.

So, instead of

{% highlight ruby %}
class User
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :age
  
  def initialize(first_name, last_name, age)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
    @age = age
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

you can simply use a single line:

{% highlight ruby %}
User = Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name, :age)
{% endhighlight %}

And this class will have exactly the same API.

But when it comes

{% highlight ruby %}
User = Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name, :age) do
  MIN_AGE = 18

  # some methods dealing with user
end

Admin = Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name, :age) do
  MIN_AGE = 21
end

# => warning: already initialized constant MIN_AGE
# => warning: previous definition of MIN_AGE was here
{% endhighlight %}

What happends here? We assumed that `MIN_AGE` was declared inside the new `Struct`, but actually it was declared on the top level:

{% highlight ruby %}
> Object::MIN_AGE
=> 18
{% endhighlight %}

And warnings were printed.

But wait, there is actually a proper way to subclass from Struct:

{% highlight ruby %}
class User < Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name, :age)
  LIMIT = 1
end

class Admin < Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name, :age)
  MIN_AGE = 21
end
{% endhighlight %}

No warnings here!
